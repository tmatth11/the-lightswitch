This is a satirical, static webpage written using TailwindCSS that features a fictional product called "The LightSwitch," which is an anti-smart home gadget and is just a regular light switch. It is able to be viewed clearly on any screen size due to Tailwind's breakpoint features and other utility classes that guarantee responsiveness. Only a small bit of JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility of the mobile menu when the hamburger button is clicked. The icon is from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/power-button_12119405?term=light+switch&page=1&position=19&origin=search&related_id=12119405" target="_blank">FlatIcon</a> and the other images on the webpage were found using Google Images.

Feel free to clone this repository to make any changes to feature your own fictional product or to use as a template for future projects that use TailwindCSS. You can also view the webpage at <a href="" target="_blank"></a>, which is hosted by <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a>.
